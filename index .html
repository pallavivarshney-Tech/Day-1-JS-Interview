    <h1 style="background-color:burlywood">Question 1</h1>
    <br>

    <h2 style="background-color:darksalmon">Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</h2>
    
  == double equals to checks only only for values not the data types but === triple equal checks for both the values as well as data type.
  <br>
  <br>
   <h1 style="background-color:burlywood">Question 2</h1>
    <h2 style="background-color:darksalmon">What is the spread operator?</h2>
<br>

  The spread operator is commonly used to make shallow copies of JS objects. Using this operator makes the code concise and enhances its readability.

<br>
<br>

 <h1 style="background-color:burlywood">Question 3</h1>
<h2 style="background-color:darksalmon">What are the differences between var, let and const? </h2>

let- we can declare the variable name in one line or in the same line itself.
     Two variables with same names aren't possible in let.
     we can reassign/update the value if already asssigned.
    Let is a block-scoped.
    Let doesn't supports hoisting.
    <br>
    <br>
    Hoisting - it brings the variables and functions at the top of thecode it supports only variable declaration but not its initialisation.
    <br>
    <br>
Const- we have to declare and initialise the variable name in same line.
Two variables with same names aren't possible in const.
we can't reassign/update the value if already initialised.
Let is a block-scoped.
Let doesn't supports hoisting.<br>
<br>
Var-
we can declare the variable name in one line or in the same line itself.
Two variables with same names are possible in var.
we can reassign/update the value if already asssigned.
Let is a global-scoped.
Var supports hoisting.

<h1 style="background-color:burlywood">Question 4</h1>
<h2 style="background-color:darksalmon">What is execution context?</h2>
  
The Execution Context contains the code that's currently running, and everything that aids in its execution. During the Execution Context run-time, the specific code gets parsed by a parser, the variables and functions are stored in memory,
 executable byte-code gets generated, and the code gets executed.
 <br>
 <br>
 There are two kinds of Execution Context in JavaScript:
<br>
Global Execution Context (GEC)
<br>
Function Execution Context (FEC)
<br>
<br>
Global Execution Context:-Whenever the JavaScript engine receives a script file, it first creates a default Execution Context known as the Global Execution Context (GEC).

  The GEC is the base/default Execution Context where all JavaScript code that is not inside of a function gets executed.
<br>
<br>
Function Execution Context:-Whenever a function is called, the JavaScript engine creates a different type of Execution Context known as a Function Execution Context (FEC) within the GEC to evaluate and execute the code within that function.

 Since every function call gets its own FEC, there can be more than one FEC in the run-time of a script.                 



 <h1 style="background-color:burlywood">Question 5</h1>
 <h2 style="background-color:darksalmon">What are closures? Give an example of closure.</h2>
<br>


A closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.
 In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

 <h1 style="background-color:burlywood">Question 6</h1>
 <h2 style="background-color:darksalmon">What is execution phase and creation phase?</h2>

 The Execution Context Object stores a lot of important data which the code in the Execution Context uses during its run-time.
 <br>
 <br>
 The creation phase occurs in 3 stages, during which the properties of the Execution Context Object are defined and set. 
 These stages are: Creation of the Variable Object
